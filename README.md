# PROG6212 POE Part 2

This program is aimed to aid Lerato in her studies by allowing her to keep track of important information about her current semester. This program also allows other students to track their semester information using an account system.


# System Requirements

* The system must use the Windows operating system (Windows 7 or a later version).
* The system must have Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or a later version installed and must be able to run an application using a WPF user interface.

# Installing and Starting the Program

## Installing the Program
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository linked at the bottom of this README file.
2. Download the zipped folder containing the program (or clone the repository onto your local machine)
3. Unzip the folder in the desired location on your local device.
## Starting the Program
There are two methods to running this program. The first method involves running the executable file directly, however if it is not available or does not work, the second method involves running the solution file in Visual Studio.
### Method 1: Running the executable file
1. Within the unzipped folder navigate to the executable (the system may refer to this file as an application) file using the following file path as a reference: 
**prog6212-poe-part2-ST10034968-main\ST10034968_PROG6212_POE\bin\Debug\net7.0-windows\ST10034968_PROG_POE.exe**
3. Open the executable to run the application.
### Method 2: Running the solution in visual studio 
1. Within the unzipped folder navigate to the solution file using the following file path as reference:
**prog6212-poe-part2-ST10034968-main\ST10034968_PROG6212_POE.sln**
3. Open the solution file in visual studio and click the green play button to run the file.
# Using the Program
* When the program starts the user will be greeted with a greeting window. The user can choose whether they want to login or register their account.
## Registering a User
* To register a user the user must click the "Register" button on the greeting window.
* The user can also access the registration window from the login window by triggering the hyperlink which is triggered by clicking like the word "Here".
* On the registration window the user can enter a unique username and password that they desire and click the "register" button to register a user.
## Logging In
* To log into the application the user can click the "Log In" button on the greeting window.
* The user can then enter their username and their password and click the "Login" button.
* If the username and password are valid the user will be greeted with the home window.
## Editing Current Semester Information
The current semester information can be changed at any time. 
* To change the current semester's information navigate to the "Edit" button next to the semester information at the top of the home window.
* This will take the user to the window in which they can input the current semester information into. 
* The user can enter the new information and click "Enter"
* The home window will reappear and the user will see the updated semester information at the top.
## Adding a Module
* To add a module the user must click the "+" button under the modules display table on the home window. 
* This will open up a window in which the user will enter the relevant information about the module.
* The user should then click the "Add" button to add the module information to memory.
* This will close the window.
* For the user to see the updated information the user can click the "Refresh" button
## Adding Study Time
* To add a study time session to be stored in the database, the user will click the "Add Study Time" button on the home window.
* A window will appear and the user will enter the relevant information about their study time session. 
* To add the study time to memory the user will click the "Add" button and the window will close
# Changes Made for POE Part 2
* The application now has an account system in which a user can use their username and password to login or create a new account (register)
* The application now stores the data entered permanently in a database. Thus the information will persist even if the user closes and reopens the application.
	* The data is stored on Microsoft Azure and thus the user can still access the same data used for the application across different machines.
# Changes Made according to POE Part 1 Feedback
I achieved a mark of 100% for my POE part 1 and hence no suggestions were given for the application and thus no amendments were made to the code used for the POE Part 1.
